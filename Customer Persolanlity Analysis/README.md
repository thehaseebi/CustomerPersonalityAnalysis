Customer Personality Analysis README

Welcome to our interactive guide on customer personality analysis using statistical tests. In this guide, we explore and visualize the differences between three common statistical tests: the t-test, ANOVA test, and Chi-Squared test. We'll walk you through essential steps in hypothesis testing, including defining the null and alternative hypotheses, choosing the appropriate test, calculating the p-value, and determining statistical significance.

1. Define the Null and Alternative Hypotheses

- Null Hypothesis (H₀): This hypothesis typically states that there is no significant difference or relationship between variables.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): This hypothesis usually represents the opposite of the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is a significant difference or relationship between variables.

2. Choose the Appropriate Test

- T-test: Used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.
- ANOVA Test Used to determine if there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups.
- Chi-Squared Test Used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

3. Calculate the P-value

- The p-value is the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (< 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

4. Determine the Statistical Significance

- If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating statistical significance.
- If the p-value is greater than the chosen significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no statistical significance.

Throughout this guide, we provide interactive examples and visualizations to help you understand and interpret the results of each statistical test. By following these steps, you can gain insights into customer behavior and make informed decisions to enhance your business strategies.
